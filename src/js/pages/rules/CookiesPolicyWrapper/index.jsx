            <h2>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h2>
            <p>
              All Cookies have expiration dates in them that determine how long they stay in your browser:

                    <b>Session Cookies</b> – these are temporary Cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) whenever you
                    close your browser. For example, session Cookies can be used to grant access to content and enable commenting
                    (things you have to login to do).

                  <p>
                    <b>Persistent Cookies</b> – these usually have an expiration date and stay in your browser until they expire,
                    or until you manually delete them. For example, persistent Cookies can be used for functionality including the
                    “Stay logged-in” tick box. We also can use persistent Cookies to better understand usage patterns so that we
                    can improve the Website for our users.

                      Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images and small blocks of code placed on website pages, ads, or
                      in our emails that allow us to determine whether you performed a specific action. When you access these

                    <p>
                      We collect many different types of information from server logs and other technologies. For example, we
                      collect information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser
                      type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses, the country and time zone
                      where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to
                      the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices require to identify and communicate with
                      each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you
                      came to our website and the website you visit after you leave our site. These tools help us improve users’
                      experience and deliver our services.

                      access our platform. We may also use these device-related techniques for associating you with different
                      devices that you may use to access our content including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target
                      advertising.
